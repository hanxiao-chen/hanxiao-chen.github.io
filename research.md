### Research Interests
I like **data science** and its **probabilistic and statistical** foundations:
- Nonparametric regression;
- Network analysis;
- Applied machine learning and data mining.

### Selected Projects

#### Shareholding Relationship Network and Stock Price Fluctuations
- Research intern at The Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA).
- Understood Topological structure of shareholding relationship network.
- Quantified stock fluctuations caused by shareholder changes utilizing regression analysis.
- Ongoing project.

#### Iterative Data Sharpening
- Research intern at The University of British Columbia.
- Develop an iterative algorithm which reduces the asymptotic bias of nonparametric regression.
- Ran simulation study with R.
- Submitted to *Computational Statistics and Data Analysis*.

#### Analyzing Stock Co-movement and its Spatial-Temporal Patterns
- Research intern at The Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA).
- Identified determinants of inter-regional stock co-movement by econometric analysis.
- Built Correlation Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph from regional stock indices to understand the dynamic of stock market inter-dependence.
- Submitted to *Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications*.
